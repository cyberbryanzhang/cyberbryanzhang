### 🧭 About Me  
I’m an undergraduate researcher at the **University of Arizona**, studying **Cyber Operations** with a focus on **AI-driven security systems**, **network forensics**, and **cyber Ethics**.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **machine intelligence** and **cyber defense** — building systems that can not only detect threats but also explain themselves.  

I see code as both an analytical instrument and a reflection of intent:  
something that should **solve** and **teach**.

### 🧠 Current Focus  
- AI-assisted **threat analysis** and **incident response**  
- Building explainable diagnostic models for **network stability**  
- Researching **forensic automation** and secure data integrity  
- Exploring how **language models** can aid human decision-making in cyber defense
